Frontend update summary (Feb 9, 2026)

I reviewed the frontend with mobile-focused testing in Chrome DevTools MCP and shipped targeted production fixes:

- Fixed router misuse in home nav (`next/router` -> `next/navigation`) to remove client router errors.
- Replaced `PostAllLikes` placeholder with a real closeable modal and wired it in post/feed cards.
- Fixed message search match indexing so single-result searches show `1/1` (not `0/1`).
- Added a hidden `SheetTitle` in message details sheet to resolve dialog accessibility/runtime issues.
- Fixed bookmark behavior on `/bookmarks` by using mutation flow, idempotent handling for 404/409, and cache invalidation.
- Reduced noisy guest auth mount behavior by avoiding forced redirects/log spam on expected 401/403.
- Minor UX cleanup: bookmark search field now clears correctly.

Validation:
- `npm run build` passed.
- Re-tested key mobile button flows in DevTools MCP (likes dialog, bookmark add/remove, message search, details sheet).

Loading/SPA UX pass (Feb 9, 2026)

- Added a shared `TabLoadingSkeleton` component with centered animated logo and layout-matching skeletons (`posts`, `grid`, `list`).
- Replaced spinner-only loading states in tab pages:
  - `/` route-group loading
  - `/bookmarks` loading + bookmark list initial load
  - `/cams` initial load
  - `/sellers` initial load
  - `/servers` initial load
- Removed blocking full-screen auth loaders in core dashboard layouts:
  - `(dashboard)/(unprotected)/(home)/layout.tsx`
  - `(dashboard)/(protected)/layout.tsx`
  - `(dashboard)/(protected)/(creators-only)/layout.tsx`
  and replaced them with immediate shell + in-layout skeleton rendering.
- Improved message UX on `/messages/[id]` by showing skeleton while conversations are still resolving instead of early “No participant found”.
- Removed hard reload behavior:
  - `window.location.reload()` -> `router.refresh()` in shared loading state.
  - Internal `window.location.href = "/"` -> `router.replace("/")` in delete-account flow.
- Removed production log noise:
  - Deleted `console.log` in fan insights container.
  - Reduced guest-session auth fetch error logging in global context provider.

Validation:
- `npm run build` passed after refactor.
- DevTools mobile + slow-network spot checks confirmed tab controls still function and loading feedback remains visible during pending route/data states.
